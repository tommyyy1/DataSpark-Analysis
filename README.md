# DataSpark-Analysis
Approach:
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
Load Data
Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.
Power BI Visualization
 Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.

Develop 10 SQL Queries
Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data. These queries should address important business questions and support the analysis steps below.

Below analysis was done by using Power Bi:
Customer Analysis
Demographic Distribution: Analyze the distribution of customers based on gender, age (calculated from birthday), location (city, state, country, continent).
Purchase Patterns: Identify purchasing patterns such as average order value, frequency of purchases, and preferred products.
Segmentation: Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key customer groups.
Sales Analysis
Overall Sales Performance: Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality
Sales by Product: Evaluate which products are the top performers in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.
Sales by Store: Assess the performance of different stores based on sales data.
Sales by Currency: Examine how different currencies impact sales figures, considering exchange rates.

Product Analysis
Product Popularity: Identify the most and least popular products based on sales data.
Profitability Analysis: Calculate profit margins for products by comparing unit cost and unit price.
Category Analysis: Analyze sales performance across different product categories and subcategories.
Store Analysis
Store Performance: Evaluate store performance based on sales, size (square meters), and operational data (open date).
Geographical Analysis: Analyze sales by store location to identify high-performing regions.
